I've implemented the dynamic programing for stitching.

I've done it using the algorithm learned in class.

For every 2 stripes that I've wanted to blend I did:
1. calculated the squared difference between them
2. calculated the cumulative matrix of the difference and the path from
each cell backwards.
3. find the path from the last row of the strip to the top.
4. create a mask where everything to the left of the path in the mask
is True and all others arr False.
5. blend the 2 stripes with the mask.

eventually return the blended panorama.

Note: in order to blend the stipes successfuly I've shrinked the stripes
to blend since when I do not shrink it the algorithm prefers to take
the left or the right most column path and that's not working very well.
By shrinking the stipe we enforce the path to go somewhere in the
middle of the stripe which makes some of the blended stripe to come from the
left and some from the right stripe.
